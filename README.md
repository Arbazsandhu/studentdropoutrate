# studentdropoutrate

# This is my project to predict student drop out rates. 
# I took more tan 15k entries on various student data such   as gpa, house hold income, scholarships and loans, marital status, parent's finanical information, location, high school gpa, college gpa and more, and used them as predictors to predict whether a student would drop out or not. I was able to create a model with an 85 % accuracy.
